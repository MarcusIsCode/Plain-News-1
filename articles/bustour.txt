Gotham, USA. â€” Local tour bus guide Wayne G. decided one morning to spice up his bus tour by taking his customers on a once in a lifetime bus tour down the newly released movie 'Joker's iconic stairs. "Radical" was one comment we managed to get a hold off from one the attendants of the ravaging bus tour. "Totally worth it" said one of the attendants, having broken both his legs when flying off the bus's open rooftop on the last LEG of the tour.
