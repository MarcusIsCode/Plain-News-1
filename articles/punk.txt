ALINAS, Calif. — Local punk Jack Hunter was upset yesterday in learning that he was being named Platt Electric Supply’s “Employee of the Month,” despite his best efforts to not give a shit about his job, deeply embarrassed sources confirmed.
“I honestly don’t know how this is possible. I come in late, I take two-hour lunch breaks, and last month, I came in so drunk I drove the forklift right through one of the bay doors,” said Hunter as he tried covering the small plaque featuring his photo with stickers. “Please don’t tell any of my friends about this. They might think I actually care about work, and they will never let me live it down. Don’t get me wrong, the $50 gift card to Safeway is pretty cool, but everything else needs to be kept quiet.”
