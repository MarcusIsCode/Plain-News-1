CAMDEN, N. J. — Self-described “gym rat and free speech activist” Eddie Massari learned today that the product he’d been applying to his face for months was merely cleansing his skin, and not caffeinating him after a workout and “augmenting his pump” as he originally believed. 
“I picked up PRIMAL Rejuvenating Coffee Scrub because I needed a quick pick-me-up after my morning workout,” said Massari in a YouTube video filmed inside his car. “The crash from energy drinks isn’t worth it, and tea is for girls. I figured this’d be a good way of getting caffeine without upsetting my stomach. But all it did was ‘clear my pores.’ What does that even mean?”

“I mean, there was a wolf on the bottle with the words, ‘CRUSH THE COMPETITION!’ in big letters on the back,” he added. “What the fuck was I supposed to think?”
